                    Blood Care dedicated to connecting blood seekers with blood donors, emphasizing its mission to save lives through timely blood donations.Few years ago we read a statistic on Kalerkantho where we seen every year in Bangladesh 55,000 died just because of not getting blood in appropriate time.Thatâ€™s hit us hard.Then decided to develop system by which patients can meet with blood donors at appropriate time.
